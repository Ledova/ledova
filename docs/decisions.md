# Product and technical decisions

[Documentation](README.md) · [Roadmap](roadmap.md)

These are recorded owner choices and their reasons. Current mechanisms live in
architecture guides. This page makes no new product, licensing or legal decision.

## Eligibility and ownership records

The first offerings target wholesale and sophisticated investors. The four
classification categories and the deliberately excluded experienced-investor
category are recorded in [legal positions](legal/positions.md#4b-issuance-payments-and-transfers-need-a-licence-a-registration-or-relief).
Those positions were taken without advice; deployment stays on test networks
with synthetic data pending the required advice.

An `associated_person` claim reaches only its named issuer's directory entries;
it does not widen the secondary market. A holder who lacks market eligibility
cannot see the market for shares they own. Revisit that trade-off before live
operation with real participants.
[Eligibility](architecture/companies-and-eligibility.md) owns enforcement details.

The register leaves amount paid blank when it cannot be established exactly;
zero would assert an amount that is not known. Classification evidence has a
fixed retention horizon, independent of account deletion. The legal basis and
uncertain clock are in [legal positions](legal/positions.md#3-the-evidence-retention-period); implementation belongs to
[the register](architecture/register.md) and [file retention](architecture/files-and-retention.md).

The operator's issuer KYC switch gates two points only: submitting a company for
review, and activating it once approved. Every later action relies on that gate
rather than checking again, including resolving a warning and reinstating a
suspended company. The owner chose this on 21 September 2026 in
[#647](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/647#issuecomment-5766230810);
[eligibility](architecture/companies-and-eligibility.md) owns the mechanism.

## The stored register

Wallets become linked to register members only through documentary authority
verified by staff: an opening's mapping, or a later reviewed link request. A
completion to an unlinked wallet waits for that link instead of creating a member,
because one person holding two wallets would otherwise become two members that
the register could never merge. Member particulars are kept while the person is
a member and then for at least the former-member retention floor, so the
register's seven-year obligation and its purge share one clock. Both were
chosen on 21 September 2026 in [#647](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/647#issuecomment-5755636585).
An entry recorded automatically names the person who authorised its change: the
staff member who approved an issue, or the transferor whose signed order is a
transfer's instrument, rather than the company owner or a service account that
took no action ([#647](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/647#issuecomment-5756732848)).
[The register](architecture/register.md) owns the mechanisms.

## Payments and settlement

Payment confirmation is stored on the subscription. The initial expected volume
is small and admin history records changes. There is no separate payment-per-tranche
model: a second payment updates the cumulative total with a note. A future
`SubscriptionPayment` table is additive if automated reconciliation needs it.

The bank-feed/payment provider remains undecided; selection and settlement
automation are unscheduled in the [current roadmap](roadmap.md#remaining-work). Incoming
AUD transfers must carry their reference text unchanged through a webhook or a
poll. References use the operator prefix plus an eight-character Crockford code
within an 18-character field. See [B7c](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/115#issuecomment-5574962513)
and [operator configuration](operations/operator-console.md).

Shares are issued through allotment; generic wallet send endpoints refuse share
tokens. On-chain recipient whitelisting and the register's Transfer-event read
also account for subsequent share movements. Bitcoin sends remain externally
built and signed; the backend now decodes and verifies them before admission.
See [transfers](architecture/transfers.md).

## Assets and portfolio presentation

Share classes stay out of the general asset list. Discovery belongs to the
eligible investor directory, while holders can read their own holdings.
A share Asset has no current price: nominal issue price is not a market valuation
of an unlisted security.

The intended portfolio presentation is one line and allocation slice per asset,
summed across chains, with an expandable per-chain split. Sending and receiving
still select a chain. A sum must identify its value sources and explicitly identify
unpriced holdings. This is a display requirement, not a claim that every client
has completed it; see [B7d](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/115#issuecomment-5574975348)
and [valuation presentation work](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/346).

## Tenancy, sessions and deployment

Registry and single-issuer modes share one operator model and tenancy boundary.
PostgreSQL RLS enforces row isolation; product selectors still distinguish issuer
management, personal accounts and discovery. See [tenancy](architecture/tenancy.md).

There is one authentication path: simplejwt sessions with browser and mobile
transports. The unused v2 session design was withdrawn; its historical ADRs remain
in [the earlier tree](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/tree/963c686/backend/docs/adr).
Email is read-only to customers; staff changes revoke their sessions.

The published compliance seed intentionally uses public figures. Operational
thresholds and evasion-sensitive rules belong outside this repository.

## Contracts compiler and toolchain

The compiler settings and the OpenZeppelin pin recorded in
[contracts and issuance](architecture/contracts-and-issuance.md#contracts) are
a contract, not a default: any change to them moves the bytecode of every
contract, so a dependency update that needs one is a toolchain change.

OpenZeppelin stays at 5.4.0 because later releases use the Cancun `mcopy`
opcode in `utils/Bytes.sol` and do not compile under `paris`. Compiling under
`cancun` instead would re-target every contract, including the ones that never
import the affected code, and nothing in the tree needs a feature from 5.5 or
later. What reopens the decision is a needed feature or an advisory against
5.4.0 itself, not a version number going up.

The contracts package declares no runtime dependencies, so `npm audit
--omit=dev`, which is what `make audit` runs for it, reports zero trivially and
proves nothing. The full audit reports advisories across the Hardhat toolchain
that `npm audit fix` cannot change: many have no published fix, some would only
be satisfied by downgrading, and the rest want major moves off the pinned
Hardhat 2 and Toolbox 6 line. That is the same migration TypeScript 7 needs, so Hardhat,
Toolbox and TypeScript are one migration decision rather than three, and the
pinned line stays until it is taken. The exposure this leaves is build
integrity, not deployed code: the deliverable is compiled bytecode, and none of
the toolchain is linked into a contract. The counts measured at the time are in
the [architecture document before the reorganization](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/blob/dc9e29597e10a7e1cf0f383dd4ac3040acb17529/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#contracts)
and the dependency reconciliation in [#518](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/518);
rerun `npm audit` in `contracts/` for the current picture rather than reading
those numbers as current.

## Clients and API types

Both clients compile `@ledova/shared` from source, without a package build step.
The mobile investor directory and subscription journey remain unscheduled in the
[current roadmap](roadmap.md#remaining-work);
shared hooks created earlier must accommodate both clients. The primary issuer
workflow remains dashboard-led. See [B7b](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/115#issuecomment-5574947880)
and [B2](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/115#issuecomment-5574848881).

Shared API types are generated from the committed OpenAPI snapshot. The owner
accepted PR #562 as the clean-release checkpoint on 2026-09-14; its reviewed head
and merge had identical trees, and all CI checks passed. The handwritten API
counterparts and partial drift parser retire with their generated replacements;
client state and cryptographic utilities retain their own types. See
[B7e](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/115#issuecomment-5575002254),
[the checkpoint approval](https://github.com/Ledova/ledova/issues/115#issuecomment-5656632666)
and [API gates](development/gates.md#the-api-type-drift-gate).

The source no-comments/no-docstrings rule remains an explicit repository choice;
[development standards](development/standards.md) defines its scope.
