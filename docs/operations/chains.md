# Chain setup and operator keys

[Operations](README.md) · [Documentation](../README.md)

Configure the local chain or Base Sepolia and align deployment ownership with the backend signer.

## Blockchain

| Variable | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL` | `ALCHEMY_BASE_URL` if set, else `http://localhost:8545` | Yes for any chain call |
| `BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN_ID` | `84532` | No; must be one of 1337, 31337, 84532, 11155111 or startup fails |
| `ETHEREUM_CHAIN_ID` | `11155111` | No; same allowed set |
| `BITCOIN_NETWORK` | `test` | No; `test` or `regtest` only |
| `EVM_ASSET_TRANSFER_HISTORY_ENABLED` | `false` | No; enables provider-backed EVM asset transfer history |
| `BLOCKCHAIN_OPERATOR_KEY` | empty | Yes to deploy, mint, whitelist, pause |
| `WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | empty | Yes for issuance |
| `SHARE_TOKEN_FACTORY_ADDRESS` | empty | Yes for issuance |
| `ATOMIC_SWAP_ADDRESS` | empty | Only for settlement |
| `STABLECOIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | empty | Only for stablecoin payment; seeds the `AUDY` deployment on `base` |
| `SWAP_ORDER_EXPIRY_HOURS` | `0.25` (15 minutes) | No; finite fractional hours are accepted |

Malformed and non-finite values are refused at settings import. This default
applies when issuing a new swap without an explicit signing window.
Existing stored deadlines and signatures are preserved. An explicit operator
override still takes precedence: remove an older `SWAP_ORDER_EXPIRY_HOURS=24`
override or set it to `0.25` to use the new default for future swaps. The ordinary
order-challenge lifetime remains 300 seconds.

## Key management

- One key, `BLOCKCHAIN_OPERATOR_KEY`, owns the factory, the whitelist registry,
  the AtomicSwap contract and every share token, and signs every deployment,
  mint, cap change, whitelist write and pause. There is no key rotation path in
  the code: a new key means redeploying or transferring ownership of each
  contract.
- Keep it outside version control. `.env` files created by
  `scripts/init-local-env.py` are mode 0600 and gitignored.
- For local work use Hardhat account #0
  (`0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`). It is
  a public development key and must never hold anything of value.
- `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` is the key Hardhat signs the deployment with; it reads
  it from `process.env` into the `localhost` and `baseSepolia` account lists.
  Export it in the deploying shell for the length of the deployment; nothing
  loads it from a file. Leave it unset against `localhost`, where Hardhat falls
  back to the node's own accounts.
- **It is not a second, independent key.**
  `contracts/scripts/deploy-all.ts` passes `deployer.address` as the owner of
  WhitelistRegistry, ShareTokenFactory, AUDY and AtomicSwap, and it is also the
  address added as the AUDY minter. The backend signs every `onlyOwner` call
  with `BLOCKCHAIN_OPERATOR_KEY`. The two keys must therefore resolve to the
  **same address**, or ownership of all four contracts must be transferred to
  the `BLOCKCHAIN_OPERATOR_KEY` address after deployment. Deploy with one key
  and operate with another, without transferring ownership, and every mint, cap
  change, whitelist write and pause reverts.
- Client `.env` files hold no secrets by construction: `VITE_` and
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_` values are embedded in the shipped bundle.

## Chain configuration

`backend/ledova_backend/chain_safety.py` refuses any EVM chain id outside `{1337, 31337, 84532,
11155111}` and any Bitcoin network other than `test` or `regtest`, at startup.
The Hardhat deployment scripts refuse any chain id outside `{1337, 31337,
84532}`. Mainnet configuration is absent by design.

Local chain, in two terminals from the repository root:

```bash
cd contracts && npx hardhat node          # chain id 31337, port 8545
npm --prefix contracts run deploy:local:core
```

The deployment writes `WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`,
`SHARE_TOKEN_FACTORY_ADDRESS`, `ATOMIC_SWAP_ADDRESS` and
`STABLECOIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to `.deployed-contracts.env`. Copy them into
`backend/.env` with `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL`, `BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN_ID=31337` and the
Hardhat account #0 key as `BLOCKCHAIN_OPERATOR_KEY`.

Base Sepolia (chain id 84532) is the supported public testnet:
`npm --prefix contracts run deploy:testnet`, with `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` and
`BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` exported in that shell. The `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`
address becomes the owner of all four contracts, so it must be the same signer
as the `BLOCKCHAIN_OPERATOR_KEY` you put in `backend/.env`, or you must transfer
ownership of WhitelistRegistry, ShareTokenFactory, AUDY and AtomicSwap to the
operator address immediately after deploying. Otherwise the backend's
`onlyOwner` calls revert against the freshly deployed contracts.

`make chain-test` does the local sequence unattended: it compiles, starts a
node, waits for `eth_chainId`, deploys the core contracts, sources
`.deployed-contracts.env` and runs
`backend/tokens/tests/test_chain_integration.py`, then stops the node.
`CHAIN_TEST_PORT` moves the whole thing — the node, the `localhost` network the
deploy connects to (through `LOCALHOST_RPC_URL`, which
`contracts/hardhat.config.ts` reads) and the backend's `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL` — so
two worktrees can run the chain test at the same time on different ports. The
target refuses to start when that port is already taken, naming the port rather
than failing later with Hardhat's `HH108`.
The chain test uses PostgreSQL. Set `POSTGRES_*` for an isolated database; the
two-worker capital-increase case requires its real row locks.

## Reaching the node from Compose

A node started on the host is not the backend container's `localhost`. Point
`BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL` at a host address reachable from the Compose network, or
run the node inside that network and use its service/container name. Host firewall
rules can block `host.docker.internal`; [provider networking](integrations.md#document-extraction)
explains that failure. Restart backend and worker after changing their environment.

The public testnet sequence and local sequence both require the deployment key
and backend operator key to identify the configured contract owner.
