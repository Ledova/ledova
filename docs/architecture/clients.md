# Clients and the shared package

[Architecture](README.md) · [Documentation](../README.md)

How dashboard and mobile consume shared TypeScript and design tokens.

`packages/shared` is consumed from source: `main` and `types` in its
`package.json` point at `src/index.ts`, which re-exports `constants`, `types`,
`services`, `utils` and `hooks`; there is no build step and no `dist/`. The
`hooks` barrel ships `ApiClientProvider`/`useApiClient` and shared hooks, so `react` and `@tanstack/react-query` are
`peerDependencies` supplied by the importing client. Mobile must supply one copy
of each: `metro.config.js` reanchors both specifiers to `mobile/index.ts`,
`jest.config.js` maps them to `mobile/node_modules`, and
`mobile/scripts/shared-peer-resolution.mjs` (the last step of
`check-resolution.mjs`) fails if a real Metro resolution from `App.tsx` and one
from a shared hook disagree.

- The dashboard resolves it through the root npm workspace link
  (`node_modules/@ledova/shared` to `packages/shared`); Vite and `tsc -b` follow
  the symlink to its real path outside `node_modules`, so the sources are
  transformed and type-checked as application code.

Every client import is `from '@ledova/shared'`. `packages/shared/src/services`
holds the API call functions both clients share; each takes the caller's axios
instance as its first argument, so each client keeps its own interceptors.

The dashboard's signed-in pages are listed once, in `DESTINATIONS`
(`packages/shared/src/constants/ui/destinations.ts`), each with its address,
title and subtitle. The dashboard builds its signed-in routes from a map keyed
by that table, so TypeScript refuses an entry without a page or a page the
table lacks, and the header takes its title from the same entry, detail pages
included. `landingFor(role)` decides where a signed-in person lands: an
investing account on its home, and a company or dual-role account on its
company. The front door, sign-in, the end of sign-up, the signed-out pages and
the trading fallback all use it; the front door, the signed-out pages and the
trading fallback wait for the role before choosing.
The mobile app does not read the table yet.

The design tokens are the single source of colour, spacing and radius values.
`make generate-tokens` runs `packages/scripts/generate-css-tokens.mjs` with
`tsx` over `packages/shared/src/constants/ui/design-tokens.ts` and writes
`dashboard/src/styles/tokens.css` and `marketing/src/tokens.css`, raw generator
output and prettier-ignored. Tailwind v4 reads that `@theme` block and derives
the utility classes (`bg-surface-base`, `text-text-body`,
`border-border-subtle`). Never edit either file: CI regenerates them after `make
build` and fails on any drift. The web clients have one look, paper, and no
theme switch. `PAPER_COLORS` is the palette. The marketing site uses it
directly (`bg-paper`, `text-ink`, `border-rule`, `bg-ledger`). `PAPER_THEME`
maps it onto the theme tokens, which are the generated defaults, so the
dashboard's `bg-surface-*`, `text-text-*` and `brand` classes, and any code
that reads `PAPER_THEME` for colours such as charts, render in paper. Both
clients bundle Newsreader for display text and Instrument Sans for everything
else. The mobile app still reads the dark and light palettes, and moves to
paper in its own change.

Mobile resolves the package through its Metro configuration and local workspace
link. Run `npm --prefix mobile run check:resolution` after dependency/resolution
changes. Internal shared imports are relative; `make check-self-imports` refuses
self-imports through the public barrel. These checks complement type checking.
